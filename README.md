## Before workshop:

Please run [a script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzoltak/whyr2018_scaling_surveys/master/before_workshop.R) on a computer with which you will attend workshop. It checks availability of packages and will try to install those that are missing or out of date. It also runs some very simple analysis allowing to check whether packages are working on your machine.
